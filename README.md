# gitlab-scripting

Scripts that utilize the GitLab API for automation and facilitating repetitive tasks.

# How to run

Ensure you have Python and pip installed. Each script will inform you if a library is required at the top. It will also display the pip command for that library.
Note: the GitLab role required is dependent on the script you are trying to run. Some scripts require Maintainer/Owner or Admin privileges.

`python script-name.py <parameters where applicable>`
